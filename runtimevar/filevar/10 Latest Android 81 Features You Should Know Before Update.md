## 1. Android Oreo (Go edition)
 
Android Oreo (Go edition) is a special configuration of Android 8.1 that is optimized for entry-level devices with 1GB or less of RAM. It offers a better performance, more storage space, data savings and security for billions of people coming online around the world. It also includes a set of apps that are designed to run faster and use less memory, such as Google Go, YouTube Go, Gmail Go and Maps Go.
 
## 2. Neural Networks API
 
The Neural Networks API is a new feature that provides accelerated computation and inference for on-device machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow Lite, Caffe2 and others. It enables apps to run models like MobileNets, Inception v3 and Smart Reply efficiently on your mobile device, without requiring an internet connection. This opens up new possibilities for intelligent and innovative apps that can take advantage of the power of machine learning.
 
## 3. Autofill framework updates
 
The Autofill framework that was introduced in Android 8.0 has been improved in Android 8.1 to make it easier for users and developers to fill out forms and logins across apps and websites. The BaseAdapter class now includes the setAutofillOptions() method, which allows you to provide string representations of the values in an adapter. This is useful for spinner controls that dynamically generate the values in their adapters. For example, you can use the setAutofillOptions() method to provide a string representation of the list of years that the users can choose as part of a credit card expiration date. Autofill services can use the string representation to appropriately fill out the views that require the data.
 
## 4. Adaptive icons
 
Adaptive icons are a new feature that allows developers to provide a full-bleed square shaped icon and OEMs will mask the icon to ensure intra-device consistency. This means that your app icons will look consistent and beautiful on different devices and launchers, regardless of their shape and size. You can also use adaptive icons to create dynamic and animated icons that respond to user interaction or system events.
 
## 5. Notification categories and snoozing
 
Android 8.1 gives you more control over how notifications can appear and how intrusive they are. You can now manage notification categories for each app, which let you customize the behavior, importance, sound, vibration and visibility of notifications from that app. You can also snooze notifications for a period of time, similar to inbox snoozing. This allows you to temporarily hide notifications from your notification shade until you are ready to deal with them.
 
## 6. Ambient screen
 
Ambient screen is a new feature that highlights the incoming notification with larger font, highlighted app name and immediate access to actions. This makes it easier for you to see and interact with important notifications without unlocking your device or opening the notification shade.
 
## 7. Project Treble
 
Project Treble is a major change to the foundations of Android that makes it easier and faster for hardware makers to deliver Android updates. It introduces a modular architecture that separates the vendor implementation from the Android OS framework. This means that device manufacturers can update their devices to a new version of Android without having to wait for chip makers to modify the software.
 
## 8. Pointer capture
 
Pointer capture is a new feature that allows the app to capture all mouse input. This is useful for apps that require precise mouse movements, such as games or remote desktop apps. When an app
